# MyMapCache

## Porpose

The porpose of this project is to create a lightweight, click-to-run tile server for my specific requirements. It should be only used as a local solution, and it's **NOT** built for heavy load services. Also, this project doesn't have complex features like vector querying; it only focus on the tile service, and doesn't include full services like a working WMTS server with all capabilities. I knew MapProxy can serve such demands, but I need some more specific customizing and easier configures.

If someone ask me why ... isn't in this, my answer is user MapProxy.

## Notes

The file `start_with_private.py` is included in the github resporitory, but it's my private code, so don't ask about anything about it.
